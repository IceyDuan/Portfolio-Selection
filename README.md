## Portfolio-Selection
Application of LSTM Neural Network in Optimizing-then-Predicting Winning and Losing Stocks
## Introduction
This is a fundamental project about Machine Learning and Qualitative Analysis. 

The detailed process is in the paper uploaded in the folder of LaTex.
## Markowitz Model Construction
This part calls the raw dataset online and use markowitz mean-variance model to get the processed dataset for machine learning.
## LSTM machine learning
This part constructs a LSTM neural network and trains it to make prediction.
